v5.3.0
======

Major changes:

* Add BaseCscTestCase as a useful base class for CSC unit tests.
  Update the unit tests to use it.

Minor changes:

* CSCs will now reject optional generic commands, if not implemented, instead of silently ignoring them.
  The optional generic commands are ``abort``, ``enterControl``, ``setValue``, and the deprecated command ``setSimulationMode``.
* The ``action`` argument to ``BaseCsc.assert_enabled`` is now optional. There is no point to setting it when calling it from ``do_...`` methods as the user knows what command was rejected.
* If a command is rejected because a CSC is in ``FAULT`` state, the error message contains the current value of the ``errorReport`` field of the ``errorCode`` event.
* `SalInfo` could not be created for a SAL component that had no commands (because such a component also has no ackcmd topic).

Deprecated APIs:

* ``lsst.ts.salobj.test_utils`` is deprecated. Please use ``lsst.ts.salobj`` instead.


Requirements:

* ts_idl 1
* ts_xml 4.6
* IDL files for Test, Script, and LOVE.
* SALPY_Test generated by ts_sal 4 (for unit tests)
