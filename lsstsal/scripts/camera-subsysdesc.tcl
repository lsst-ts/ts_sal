The wavefront sensing system will consist of wavefront curvature monitors and/or Shack Hartmann sensors in or around

measurements for feedback compensation. The feedback control of telescope alignment will be handled by the
Telescope Control System.
<P>
Four special purpose rafts, mounted at the corners of the science array, will contain wavefront sensors and guide sensors.
Wavefront measurements are accomplished using curvature sensing, where the spatial intensity distribution of stars is
measured at equal distances on either side of focus. Each curvature sensor will be composed of two CCD detectors, with
one positioned slightly above the focal plane, and the other positioned slightly below the focal plane. The CCD technology
for the curvature sensors will be identical to that used for the science detectors in the focal plane except that the curvature
sensor detectors will be half size so they can be mounted as an in/out defocus pair. Detailed analyses have verified that this
configuration can recover the wavefront to the required accuracy.

<P>
The basic requirement of the Camera Thermal Comtrol System is to allow the solidstate
detectors that form the Focal Plane Array (FPA) to operate at ~ 170K to reduce the contribution of thermal noise to the electronic signals while in parallel optimizing
quantum efficiency (QE). The thermal gradient across the sensors must also be adequately
reduced (Â±0.30K) to maintain uniform quantum efficiency in each pixel. For efficient camera
operation, thermal stability of the FPA is necessary to maintain optical sensor performance as well as to eliminate the growth of mechanical distortions to the FPA, once it is aligned. 
<P>
The additional functions of the thermal control system are to provide a particulate free environment for the sensor surfaces, heat extraction from both the front end and back end electronics systems, and antifog protection for the three optical elements.   The camera is composed of a cryostat containing the FPA and its readout electronics and an outer camera body which houses the cryostat, shutter, L2 optic, and the five filters and filter exchange mechanism. The cryostat is closed by the L3 optic and the outer camera body by the L1 optic. The cryostat is operated at ~10e-6 Torr vacuum while the region between the cryostat and outer body will contain an inert gas (eg: dry nitrogen will be assumed) regulated to be slightly above atmospheric pressure. The temperature of the N2 gas will be controlled to maintain a stable thermal envelope. The other important role of the inert gas is to prevent degradation of the filter coatings.

<P>
A rectangular aperture that moves across the array controls the exposure time for all pixels. Equal exposure time requires the opening edge and the closing edge to have the same motion profile in time. This is achieved by using one long sheet with a central rectangular aperture of constant width. For compact storage, the sheet attaches to and wraps around two rollers to form a scroll. Tthere are two closed positions so the sheet advances in the same direction from closed to open to closed. The sheet reverses direction for the next cycle.  This would be of great benefit if the minimum exposure time were much shorter than currently required. 
<P>
Controlling the exposure time to millisecond precision is equivalent to controlling position of the aperture edges to several tenths of millimeters. Standard feedforward and feedback control techniques  maintain acceptable following error (i.e., the controller component of error) for this well defined motion profile. Placing sensors on the rollers is easy and reliable and the average of the two accounts for the effective roller radius changing as the sheet rolls up on itself. This effect is small for a thin metal sheet. In addition, a metal sheet is opaque, does not outgas, can be processed for high fatigue strength and low wear, and is stable and rigid in plane."
